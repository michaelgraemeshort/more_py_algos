# given a set of values, each with a weight and a value, determine which items give the maximum value for a given weight limit
# items can be "broken" such that fractions of items and corresponding values can be packed
# unlike coin change problem in that items are NOT infinite in quantity
# contrast with 0-1 knapsack problem

# sort items by descending order of value per unit weight
# pack highest value items that do not exceed weight limit
