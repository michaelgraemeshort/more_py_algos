title: Singly Linked List
---

See [here](https://github.com/michaelgraemeshort/more_py_algos/blob/main/revision/linked_lists/singly_linked_list.py) for a singly linked list class loosely modelled on Python's built-in list type.

- [Slicing custom objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2936863/implementing-slicing-in-getitem)

**Notes**

- The difference between an iterable and a sequence is that sequences can be indexed. See [here](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/loop-better-deeper-look-iteration-python) and [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-iterator-tutorial)
- Could get ideas for replicating the functionality of Python built-in data types (in this case, lists) by browsing Python source code
- Not that I'm much good at reading C
- Should really read that CPython Internals book I bought
- Some of these methods might be better expressed using structural pattern matching but how many people are using 3.10 right now?
