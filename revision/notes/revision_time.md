title: Revision Time
---

It's taken me a year to get through [this excellent Udemy course by Elshad Karimov](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp-in-python/) and now I've forgotten half of the material, so it's Revision Time.

**Recursion**
- [Greatest Common Divisor](https://michaelgraemeshort.github.io/2021/12/21/greatest_common_divisor.html)
- [Decimal to Binary](https://michaelgraemeshort.github.io/2021/12/14/decimal.m_to_binary.html)

**Linked Lists**
- Implement linked list classes, including common methods:
    - [Singly-linked](https://github.com/michaelgraemeshort/more_py_algos/blob/main/revision/linked_lists/singly_linked_list.py)
    - [Doubly-linked](https://github.com/michaelgraemeshort/more_py_algos/blob/main/revision/linked_lists/doubly_linked_list.py)
    - Circular singly-linked
    - Circular doubly-linked
- Solve the following:
    - Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
    - Return *n*th to last element of a singly linked list
    - Partition a linked list around a given value
    - "Sum Lists"
    - Determine if two given linked lists intersect

**Stacks and Queues**
- Implement stack and queue classes:
    - Python list-based:
        - with size limit
        - without size limit
    - Linked list-based:
        - with size limit
        - without size limit
- Implement a circular queue class using a Python list
- Solve:
    - Implement three stacks using a single Python list
    - Design a stack that has a min() method that returns the smallest element
    - "Stack of Plates"
    - Implement a queue using two stacks
    - "Animal Shelter"

**Binary Trees**
- Implement tree classes, including traversal, search, insertion and deletion methods:
    - Linked list-based binary tree
    - Python list-based binary tree
    - Linked list-based binary SEARCH tree
    - AVL tree
    
**Binary Heap**
