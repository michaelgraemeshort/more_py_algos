# hash table? node: height from bottom up?
# get height of a given node by...?
# add one to height of child with greater height
# how to start at the bottom?
# level order traversal backwards?
# another hash table of node: children?
# no as not all unique values
# could use node memory addresses rather than values
# off-piste, probably
# top-down:
# get height of left subtree
# get height of right subtree
# compare
# get height of subtree by:
# get height of left subtree
# get height of right subtree
# recursion
# base case: subtree does not exist - height == 0
# otherwise, height += 1, or something
# the problem: isBalanced should return a bool, but height is an int
# helper function?
